            PLEASE READ THIS&nbsp;MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT&nbsp;(“AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APPLICATION SERVICES OFFERED BY ZeMoSo Technologies, INC and its affiliates via <a href="http://www.inapptext.com">http://www.inapptext.com</a> (“ZeMoSo”).
          </p>
          <p>
            THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT GOVERN YOUR USE OF ZeMoSo’s APPLICATION SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE ZeMoSo’s APPLICATION SERVICES. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS BELOW, OR BY USING ZeMoSo’s APPLICATION SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AND THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT (“CUSTOMER”) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. IF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS.</p>
          <p>
            This Agreement is entered into as of the date you accept these terms or use the ZeMoSo Application Services (“Effective Date”).
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">LICENSE TO USE THE SERVICES</h3>
          <p>
            Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, ZeMoSo grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Application Services (as defined herein) for Customer’s internal use and not for resale or further distribution. Customer’s right to use the Application Services is limited by all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Except for this license granted to Customer, ZeMoSo and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Application Services, including all related intellectual property rights. The Application Services are protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including United States copyright law and international treaties. “Application Services” shall mean the online, web-based applications ordered by Customer through an Order Form and provided by ZeMoSo via <a href="http://www.inapptext.com">http://www.inapptext.com</a> or other designated websites or IP addresses as communicated to Customer by ZeMoSo. An “Order Form” shall mean either (a) a document signed by both parties identifying the Application Services purchased by Customer and made available by ZeMoSo pursuant to this Agreement or (b) Customer’s selection and acceptance of a specific pricing tier via the online purchasing process at <a href="http://www.inapptext.com">http://www.inapptext.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement or as may be expressly permitted by applicable law, Customer will not, and will not permit or authorize any third party to: (i) reproduce, modify, translate, enhance, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or create derivative works of any of the Application Services; (ii) rent, lease or sublicense access to any of the Application Services; or (iii) circumvent or disable any security or technological features or measures of the Application Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pricing tiers for the Application Services can be found at <a href="http://www.inapptext.com">http://www.inapptext.com</a>. Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, fees for the first month of the Application Services are prorated based on the calendar days remaining in the particular month at the pricing tier selected by Customer provided that in the event Customer’s usage of the Application Services exceeds the pricing tier selected by Customer, fees are adjusted as follows: for the previous month, ZeMoSo will charge the lower of any overage cost for usage in excess of the pricing tier Customer selected versus the retroactive upgrade cost to the next higher tier. The subsequent month is charged at the then-current pricing tier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless a subscription term of a longer duration is indicated in the applicable Order Form (a “Subscription Term”), the Application Services will automatically renew on a monthly basis unless and until Customer terminates the Application Services by providing written notice to ZeMoSo (email is acceptable) or selecting the cancellation option on the dashboard of the Application Services, and such termination will be effective as of the last day of the calendar month during which such termination notice is received. Any Subscription Term specified in an Order Form will automatically renew for additional terms of twelve months each unless and until either party provides the other with written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days in advance of the last day of the then-current Subscription Term.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, fees due hereunder will be billed to Customer’s credit card and Customer authorizes the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorizes ZeMoSo (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until Customer or ZeMoSo cancels or terminates the Application Services as set forth in Section 1.4 above; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due upon demand. Customer must provide current, complete and accurate billing and credit card information. Customer agrees to pay all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of the credit card may charge a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which Customer shall be responsible to pay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer will be responsible for payment of any applicable sales, use and other taxes and all applicable export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges (other than taxes based on ZeMoSo’s income), and any related penalties and interest for the grant of access rights hereunder, or the delivery of related services. Customer will make all required payments to ZeMoSo free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments to ZeMoSo will be Customer’s sole responsibility, and Customer will, upon ZeMoSo’s request, provide ZeMoSo with official receipts issued by appropriate taxing authorities, or such other evidence as ZeMoSo may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">ACCESS TO THE SERVICES</h3>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo does not provide the equipment required to access the Application Services. Customer is responsible for all fees charged by third parties related to Customer’s access and use of the Application Services (e.g. Charges by Internet service providers).
          </p>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Application Services without notice. ZeMoSo will not be liable to Customer or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Application Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post, or remove any material that Customer posts or submits for posting, and to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Application Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">RESTRICTIONS</h3>

            Customer must comply with all applicable laws when using the Application Services. Except as may be expressly permitted by applicable law, or as ZeMoSo may authorize expressly in writing, Customer will not, and will not permit anyone else to: (i) store, copy, modify, distribute, or resell any of the information; audio, visual, and audiovisual works, or other content made available on the Application Services, or compile or collect any such content as part of a database or other work; (ii) use any automated tool (e.g., robots, spiders) to access or use the Application Services; (iii) rent, lease, or sublicense Customer’s access to the Application Services to another person; (iv) use any Application Services for any purpose except for Customer’s own internal use; (v) circumvent or disable any digital rights management, usage rules, or other security features of the Application Services; (vi) use the Application Services in a manner that overburdens, or that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of, the Application Services; or (vii) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) on any portion of the Application Services.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
          <p>
            The Application Services are designed to allow Customer to learn how Customer’s customers and other individuals (“Authorized Users”) use Customer’s mobile applications, mobile websites or web properties by giving Customer the ability to collect information and data (collectively, “Customer Content”) based on their interaction with Customer’s mobile applications where Customer has integrated the Application Services and send personalized text or content to them. This is achieved through an application SDK provided by ZeMoSo. Some information is automatically collected from or about Authorized Users when Customer uses the Application Services. If Customer integrates an official ZeMoSo iOS, Android, library in Customer’s mobile applications, mobile websites or web properties it may through an option set by the Customer, collect the following: the time of an event, information about the device an Authorized User is on such as their operating system and browser, as well as the city/country location of Authorized Users, tokens and IDs for push notifications. In addition, Customer can choose what other Customer Content Customer wants to collect such as age, IP addresses, user names, real names, email addresses and other custom properties. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection regulations. Further, Customer agrees to not use the Application Services to send ZeMoSo sensitive information where unauthorized disclosure could cause material, severe, or catastrophic harm or impact to ZeMoSo, any data subjects or third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo collects, stores, and uses Customer Content to maintain and improve the Application Services. ZeMoSo may also use Customer Content in an aggregated form for ZeMoSo’s own purposes. The Application Services transfer data to servers that store Customer Content in the U.S. and outside the U.S. ZeMoSo only shares User information with others under special circumstances as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>With third parties who work on ZeMoSo’s behalf to provide the Application Services;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process (provided that ZeMoSo will notify Customer if ZeMoSo has received a lawful request for Customer’s information);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To protect the rights and property of ZeMoSo, its agents, customers, and others including to enforce ZeMoSo’s agreements, policies, and terms of use;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In an emergency, including to protect the personal safety of any person; and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For the purposes of a business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or a part of ZeMoSo’s business or assets (business deals may include, for example, any merger, financing, acquisition, divestiture, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo provides Customer with access to Customer Content and ability to delete any Customer Content. ZeMoSo also takes commercially reasonable steps to safeguard Customer Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer agrees to provide appropriate notices to Users about, and if required by applicable laws obtain appropriate consent from Users for, Customer’s information collection and use practices relating to Customer’s use of the Services and Customer’s use of cookies for tracking purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZeMoSo may also collect registration and other information about Customer as ZeMoSo’s customer through ZeMoSo’s website. ZeMoSo’s collection and use of information collected about Customer on ZeMoSo’s website is governed by the ZeMoSo Privacy Policy, available at&nbsp;<a href="privacy.html">http://www.inapptext.com/privacy.html</a>.
